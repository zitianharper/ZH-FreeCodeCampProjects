<h3 id="Club-Structure">The Club Structure</h3>
<p>In Italy, students pay around €900 per year for club subscription.<p>

<p>The subscription covers:<br/>
- Training in the club for an unlimited number of days.<br/> 
- Lessons with coaches.</p>

<h3>Individual Lessons</h3>
  <p>Individual lessons with coaches are free!<br/>

It is uncommon for coaches, no matter what level, to take money for giving individual lessons.<br/> 

In practice, most students will have 2 lessons per week. Usually, coaches give more lessons to students that they like (ones that take the sport more seriously)

<h3>Athletes and the Civil Service</h3>
<p>Most Italian “professional” fencers earn a stable salary by joining the ‘sport section’ of a civil service body (they are often army/police bodies) <br/>
