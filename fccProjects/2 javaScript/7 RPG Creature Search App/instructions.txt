Build an RPG Creature Search App
In this project, you'll build an app that will search for creatures from an RPG game by name or ID and display the results to the user. To retrieve the creature data and images, you'll use freeCodeCamp's RPG Creature API.

Note: The first 13 steps must be completed inside the index.html file.

Objective: Build an app that is functionally similar to https://rpg-creature-search-app.freecodecamp.rocks.
